# Who are we?
We are a team of "talented" developers creating engaging games. Our goal is to develop games for people, and all our projects will be open source and without anti-piracy systems. We believe you can pirate our games, but if you like themâ€”please support us by purchasing.

# Current Projects
At the moment, we donâ€™t have any finished games, but weâ€™ve been working hard on the project **Eternal Beta**.

## [Eternal Beta](https://github.com/Kacianoki/Eternal-Beta)

**Eternal Beta** is an exciting RTS about hacking, where youâ€™ll need to hack other players to become the most famous hacker on the planet. The game is interesting for both casual players and programmers due to various difficulty levels:

- At the high level, youâ€™ll have to use real vulnerabilities and analyze traffic, spoofing packets and catching opponents off guard.
- At the minimal difficulty level, youâ€™ll just be entering commands in the console :/

At the start of the game, players will have the weakest computers, but by conducting research, youâ€™ll be able to unlock new technologies and components, allowing you to really go all out.

Additionally, the game features a marketplace, dynamic weather, and smart AI (we tried), which will keep you entertained.
